Take your time and first enjoy cloud computing experience with Onyxia by attending [Lab 0](https://github.com/TheAIWizard/Hands-on-Spark-Lab/blob/main/First-steps-with-cloud-computing/First-steps-with-cloud-computing.md) :point_left::seat: 

# Prerequesites

You'll have to create an account on the [Data Lab](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/home) first to be able to launch the courses and access the Jupyter notebooks.

Users can create their own accounts and authenticate with their own credentials.
