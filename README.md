Click on the [Lab 1,2,3](#spark-tutorials) link at the bottom :point_down: to launch a jupyter notebook according to your level of ability :mechanical_arm: :brain: :chart:

# Overview

Welcome to this tutorial folks :rainbow: 
We are hoping that you'll develop some serious data science skills :fire::fire::fire:  and enjoy this experience with the SSP Cloud Data Lab supported by [Onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web) . :sparkles:

Take your time and first enjoy cloud computing experience with Onyxia by attending [Lab 0](https://github.com/TheAIWizard/Hands-on-Spark-Lab/blob/main/First-steps-with-cloud-computing/First-steps-with-cloud-computing.md) :point_left::seat: 

# Prerequesites

You'll have to create an account on the [Data Lab](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/home) first to be able to launch the courses and access the Jupyter notebooks.

Users can create their own accounts and authenticate with their own credentials.
